        <p>There are <b>seven</b> geologically distinct regions that make up the Canadian Shield, referred to as <u>Provinces</u>. Various types of mineral deposits and different rock formations existing throughout different time periods are what separates these Provinces.</p>

        <h4>Bear Province</h4>

        <p>The most prevalent metal of Bear Province is uranium; having numerous occurrences of uraninite, primarily in veins, known to exist throughout a substantial area of the province. In the North, basaltic lava flows contain mineralized copper and small amounts of native silver, cobalt, nickel, copper, and gold can also be found east of Great Bear Lake. </p>

        <h4>Slave Province</h4>

        <p>The Slave Province consists of belts of Archean volcanic and sedimentary rocks that primarily trend north. The dominant metal in the Slave Province is gold, with greater quantities pertaining to southern volcanic rocks and intrusions. Minor deposits of copper, lead, cobalt, nickel, and native silver have also been encountered in the south. In the east, pegmatites bearing trace levels of lithium, tungsten, beryllium, niobium, tantalum, and tin can be found. Significant deposits of the base metals: uranium and iron, are reported rare to absent. Today, the Slave Province is well-known for its diamonds, ever since the discovery of kimberlite pipes in the early 1990s. The Diavik mine, one of the world's leading producers of gem diamonds, has produced over 100 million carats in its time.</p>

        <h4>Churchill Province</h4>

        <p>The Churchill Province is the largest region in the Canadian Shield, comprising an extensive variety of Archean and Proterozoic-aged rocks. The Flin Flon belt of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, as well as the Ennadai belt of the Northwest Territories, are home to polymetallic sulfide deposits and many instances within the association of copper, zinc, gold, and silver. Nickel-copper sulfide ores are found near mafic to ultramafic intrusions in Manitoba's Lynn Lake and Thompson districts, in addition to in the Northwest Territories' Rankin Inlet and Ferguson Lake. The majority of gold lode occurrences are gold-bearing quartz veins in sheared volcanic and sedimentary rocks near porphyry granite intrusions.</p>

        <h4>Superior Province</h4>

        </div>

        <p>The Superior Province is defined by eastern trending belts of Archean supracrustal rocks surrounded by expanses of granitic rocks. The volcanic rocks are connected to a multitude of stratiform polymetallic sulphide deposits, including the copper-zinc-silver-gold association similarly to the Churchill Province. The deposits can be located in volcanic rocks and accompanying mafic intrusions, or simply in surrounding sediments. The volcanically active belts are home to numerous gold lode deposits. While banded iron deposits are abundant in the volcanic-sedimentary belts. Deposits of beryllium, lithium, and molybdenum can also be found in granitic and pegmatitic rocks within Ontario and Quebec.</p>

        <h4>Grenville Province</h4>

        <p>The Grenville Province comprises a variety of Precambrian-era rocks. Highly metamorphosed iron formations that constitute the southern extension of the Aphebian rocks of Labrador Geosyncline contain significant magnetite-hematite deposits. Mafic intrusions in the south border smaller titaniferous magnetite skarn deposits. In limestone from southeast Ontario and Quebec, there are small magnetite occurrences devoid of titanium. Ilmenite, the primary ore of titanium, occurs in substantial amounts as magmatic segregations in the Elsonian anorthosites of southern Quebec. In addition to the localized occurrences of gold, lead-zinc, and molybdenum, often magnesium ores - dolomite and brucite, are also located throughout the province.</p>

        <h4>Southern Province</h4>

        <p>Despite being one of the Shield's smaller structural provinces, the Southern Province has produced a lot of valuable minerals. The Sudbury nickel deposits are located in thick sills of norite, quartz diorite, and micropegmatite situated at the junction between the Aphebian strata and Archean crystalline rocks. Along with nickel, significant quantities of copper and smaller quantities of silver, platinum, and gold are also present in the area.</p>

        <h4>Nain Province</h4>

        <p>The Nain province is the smallest of the seven, and operates a singular mine containing nickel, copper, and cobalt called Voisey's Bay, which is situated in northern Labrador.</p>
