        <h3>The Impacts of Mining on Indigenous Groups</h3>

        <p>In the past, lives of Indigenous people were constantly threatened by the environmental destruction arising from mining expansions that were wrongly infringing into their territories.<br><br>Indigenous people were put at risk for radiation and harmful chemical exposure imposed by nearby mine sites, among other health concerns. Fortunately, direct negotiations between mining companies and Indigenous communities have since become commonplace, all while upholding the communities' treaty rights to lands, territories, and resources.<br><br>The Canadian government has pledged to reconcile with Indigenous communities and promise that Indigenous peoples remain full partners in the mineral development process in Canada.</p>
