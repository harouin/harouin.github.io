        <h3>How does the physical environment affect us and how do we affect it back?</h3>

        <p>Mining is suspected to have begun in prehistoric times. With the first material mined being flint, which had a conchoidal breaking pattern that allowed us to break it into sharp edges for use as knives and arrowheads. Now, centuries later, we are still innovating everyday at a faster rate than ever with mining now a primary pillar of the economy in many countries. As the population increases, the demand for more homes, vehicles, technology and technological advancements grows - too. Especially with the concept of modernism taking over architecture, and the desire to discover more of the world by improving our designs of spacecrafts and submarines. Right now, we are completely reliant on mining, in a way that wont hold up forever. With how unsustainable and harmful as it is, we are slowly destroying the planet for our selfish societal desires as humans.<br><br><br><u>Image: The Importance of Environment Management in Mining - (Intergovernmental Forum)</u></p>
