        <h3>What use comes from Metal?</h3>
    
        <p>Metals are a class of elements characterized by their tendency to lose electrons, making them suitable conductors of heat and electricity. There are countless varieties and grades of metal available, with each utilized for different types of appliances. The modern society's standard of living depends on metals, as it is necessary in all processes of the production and distribution of electricity. Like creating the turbines that convert mechanical energy into electricity and the stations that supply them to homes. Many daily household items are made of metal through milling, grinding, welding, and soldering.</p>
