        <h3>The Impacts of Mining on the Environment</h3>

        <img id="po" src="images/waterpo.diagram.jpg" alt="Water Pollution Diagram">

        <h4>Pollution</h4>

        <p>Large amounts of soil are dug, processed, and harmed from on-site chemicals causing contamination. Part of the process of extracting materials from the ground require using fossil-fuel machinery and acidic or arsenic chemicals such as cyanide or lead - which are both harmful to organisms and the environment. Contaminated soil may also contaminate groundwater, which are particularly danger if nearby communities drink from them.<br><br>Drilling machinery and extracting minerals from ore causes the release of huge amounts of dust particles and other expelled chemicals. These particles become airborne and greatly worsen the air quality, both miners and civilians that live near mine sites are susceptible to "Black Lung Disease".</p>

        <h4>Deforestation & Animal Endangerment</h4>

        <img id="de" src="images/defor.stat.jpg" alt="Deforestation Statistics in Canada">

        <p>To dig mines, large remote spaces must be cleared, which results in mass tree chopping. Deforestation causes an increase in the quantity of carbon emissions discharged into the atmosphere. In order to make the air safe to breathe, trees absorb carbon dioxide from it and transform it into oxygen. The fewer trees there are, the- -more carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere, accelerating global warming.<br><br>Biodiversity is also threatened as a result of cutting many trees down in an area. There are many kinds of plants and animals found in forests, many of those species may become extinct as a result of mass clearing or fires as their homes are destroyed with no place to relocate.</p>
